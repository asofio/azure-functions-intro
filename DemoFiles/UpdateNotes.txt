Update reading data from POST body:

Replace HttpRequest with modelbinding to an Order.  Also mention that the HttpRequest object can still be received.

Order order,.....

return new OkObjectResult($"The sales tax for {salesTax.State} is {salesTax.Percentage}");

Cosmos Input Binding:
            [[CosmosDB(
                databaseName: CosmosDatabase,
                collectionName: CosmosContainer,
                ConnectionStringSetting = CosmosDBConnectionSetting,
                Id = "{StateAbbreviation}",
                PartitionKey = "{StateAbbreviation}")] SalesTax salesTax,


Service Bus Output Binding:

    Add parameter to function:
    [ServiceBus(OutboundServiceBusQueue, Connection = ServiceBusConnectionSetting)] IAsyncCollector<OrderResult> sbOutput,

    To publish message:
    await sbOutput.AddAsync(orderResult);

Change to Service Bus Trigger:

    [ServiceBusTrigger("InboundOrders", Connection = ServiceBusConnectionSetting)] Order order,

    Change Task<IAsyncResult> to Task

    Remove http IAsyncResult.


Best Practices Example:

    Move HttpClient to be statically instantiated.

    private static HttpClient _httpClient = new HttpClient();
